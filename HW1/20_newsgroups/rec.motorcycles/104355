OK -- so we've got a hotly contested BMWOA election and some inept 
leadership.

My question is the history of the BMW organization that lead to the
formation of the BMWRA. Was there something going on in the OA years
ago that precipitated the formation of two competing owner's groups?

Just to stave off flames: I'm a (relatively new) member of both groups
and besides a difference in the slickness of the magazines, it seems
the major difference is that the RA guys seem to have more fun. . .
