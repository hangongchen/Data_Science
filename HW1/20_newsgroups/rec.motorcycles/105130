I got a sample of black reflector material, maybe from "Conspicuity"?
It is black but reflects silver if the angle of incidence is shallow.
Whoever it was I got it from sold/sells kits that fit BMW (and other
brands?) of luggage and fenders. Don't know what I did with the sample;
the kits seemed too expensive, as I recall.
