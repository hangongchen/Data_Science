  Hi people!:


  I'm looking for X Servers for DOS or Windows.

  I've already seen Desqview/X and XVision but I'd like to be
 aware of other choices.

  Is there anything on the public domain or shareware ?

  And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive
 pricing ?

  What about incompatibilities ? Window managers ?

  Any info is welcome.



  Thanx in advance.


  C U!
