|> We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process

I'm most of the way through adding a grammar for parsing the #if expressions.
I don't know when I'll be able to get back to it; you're welcome to what I 
have so far. I haven't looked at other versions of makedepend, which may solve
the problem more elegantly.
