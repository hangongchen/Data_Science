Does anyone know the difference between MOOLIT and OLIT?  Does Sun
support MOOLIT?  Is MOOLIT available on Sparcstations?

I have recntly downloaded a copy of wkshTree written by Eric Wallengren
of Univel.  There are many widgets that are apparently available only
to MOOLIT but not OLIT.

Is there a wkshTree program available under OLIT?
