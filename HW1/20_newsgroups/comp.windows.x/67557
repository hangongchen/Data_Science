A while back (i.e., several months) someone posted a method for allowing 
a user to choose (via XMenu and something else??) a window manager 
interactively at X startup time. Could the original poster (or anyone 
else) please Email a copy of the method to me, as I have lost the 
original posting? Thanks.
