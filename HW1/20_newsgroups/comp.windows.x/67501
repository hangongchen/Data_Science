	Several ways are available -- pageview (which I think came
with our system, so I can't point), ghostview (with ghostscript), and
the new xv 3.00 package all do so.  I recommend the latter two,
especially xv if you want to do any conversion.

	I'm not sure offhand, but I will attempt to mail you the
comp.lang.postscript FAQ, which has a list of utilities.
