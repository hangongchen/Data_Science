HI, all
    I study about WM_DELETE_WINDOW atom in Open Look. I study the book -->
"Unix Desktop guide to OPEN LOOK", I run the example of chapter 8, but It
is not the result described as book's figure 8.1. Dose anyone read the book?
Or run the example (winprop.c)? What is the problem?
    I am curious about WM_DELETE_WINDOW programming... Anyone help me?
                       Thanks in advance for any help!!!
                                                            IOP
