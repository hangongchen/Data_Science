As I announced at the X Technical Conference in January, I would like to
make Imake-TeX, the Imake support for using the TeX typesetting system,
publically available. Currently Imake-TeX is in beta test here at the
computer science department of Dortmund University, and I am looking for
some more beta testers, preferably with different TeX and Imake
installations.
