Can someone point me in the direction of any papers (not necessarily
formally conducted studies) discussing how much traffic X apps generate
for the network, particularly in comparison with curses-bases apps 
over telnet?  Also, does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard
input a line at a time?  Can the X client control this, asking for
keystrokes immediately?  Thanks in advance for any feedback!
