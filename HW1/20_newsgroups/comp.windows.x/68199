Hi All,

I've heard of a commercial package named ZINK, that could convert MS-Windows
source-code to XWindows source-code (C). The only problem is, the package
isn't available in Holland (at least, I can't find it anywhere :-( )

Is there another package (preferrably free- or shareware), that can do the 
same thing? And if so, where can I find or buy it?

Thanks in advance

Arjen
