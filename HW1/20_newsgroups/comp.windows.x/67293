I'd appreciate any feedback on capture/playback tools for use with X clients.

I have pulled XTM from public domain but it appears to be set up to test
X servers not X clients. 

Any comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great -
particularly XTM, XRunner, Autotester, and SRI's CAPBAK, SMARTS and EXDIFF.
