I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell
repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is
run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X
server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program
have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by
emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?
