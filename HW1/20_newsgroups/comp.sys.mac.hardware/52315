Hello Forrest:

I noticed your recent posting regarding crashes of the Duo 230.  At the
present I own a PB100 and a IIsi.  I had been contemplating selling both and
geting a 230.  Based upon your experiences would you make that
recommendation?

This is the first time I had heard of any problems with the Duo.  Is this the
norm.  Have you been able to work around the problems?

Thanks for responding!
