: Does anyone know about these studies? Or have experience with feverfew?

I keep an accurate log of my migraine attack frequency; feverfew didn't
seem to do anything for me.  However, eliminating caffeine seems to pre-
vent the onset of migraine in my case.  In other words, no caffeine, no 
migraines.
