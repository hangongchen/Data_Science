From my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature,  I think that the
benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to
other kinds of risks.  (This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan
grilling.)  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  This MAY make sense because vit. C
is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the 
chemicals in question.  Bon Apetit!
