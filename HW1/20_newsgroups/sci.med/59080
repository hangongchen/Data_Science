My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones. She says that because she has no
medical insurance, she cannot get them removed.

My question: Is there any way she can treat them herself, or at least mitigate
their effects? Any help is deeply appreciated. (Advice, referral to literature,
etc...)

Thank you,
