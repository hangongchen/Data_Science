I looked for diab in my .newsrc and came up with nuthin. Anyone have
any good sources for where I can read? In particular, I'm interested
in finding out more about intravenous insulin injection for hepatic
vein liver activation. (Whew! Wotta mouthful!)

Anything that smells like a pointer would be helpful: newsgroup,
mailinglist, etc....

Many thanks.
