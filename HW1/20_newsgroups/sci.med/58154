I am currently doing a group research project on the drug Xanax.  I would
be exponentially gracious to receive any and all information you could
provide
me regarding its usage, history, mechanism of reaction, side effects, and
other pertinent information.  I don't care how long or how short your 
response is.

Thanks in advance!
Brent E. Shelley
