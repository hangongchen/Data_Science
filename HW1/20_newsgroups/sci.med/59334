To Whomever who can help me,

	I am a doctor from Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia. I have recently hooked up my 
private home computer to EMail via the local telephone company. I am really interested
in corresponding with other Doctors or medical researchers through Email. I also hope
to be able to subscribe to a news network on medicine.

Can someone please tell me what I should do? I am completely new to this and have no 
idea about the vast capabilities of Email.

Thank you for your attention.
