can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis?   i heard
it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names
of a specialist/surgeon in  the north carolina research triangle  park
area (raleigh/durham/chapel  hill) who is familiar with the condition,
i would really appreciate it.

thanks.
