        Hello,

        Just one quick question:
        My father has had a back problem for a long time and doctors
        have diagnosed an operation is needed. Since he lives down in
        Mexico, he wants to know if there is a hospital anywhere in
        the United States particulary famous for this kind of surgery,
        kind of like Houston has a reputation for excellent doctors
        in eye surgery. Any additional info or pointers will be
        appreciated a whole lot!...


                Thanks in Advance.

                        Gary Sheutter.
                        AT&T Bell Labs.
