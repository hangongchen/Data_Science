	All you BD apologists seem to be conveniently forgetting
Jonestown.  It would have looked much worse if the feds had just
waited till they all committed suicide.  This was a no win situation,
although the final raid was a tragic failure - they should have
been able to get more people out alive.

P.S.  The title for this thread is ridiculous.  Feds couldn't give a hoot
about their religous ideas - weapons was the problem.  Similar situations
have popped up with those "I'm not gonna pay taxes" freaks in Idaho, etc. 
where religion clearly has no bearing.  Religous freedom here, as an issue,
is a complete smokescreen.
