BULLSHIT. How many lakes have ceased to be able to support life from
purely natural pollution? Man has already done this to scores of lakes.
Also, much of the "degredation" you cite was done by cows and pigs.

And why do think there are so many cows around?

Could it be.......cause people raise them?
