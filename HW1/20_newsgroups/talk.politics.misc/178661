	If you have something reasoned and intelligent to say then you should
post. If all you can do is rant and rave- save it.

	True conservatism is cutting spending and taxes. It's a matter of
debate just how succesful the last few presidents have been at that.

	I hear it again and again, and I've noticed far more often from 
liberals than anyone else- "if you don't agree with me you are close-minded"
	Look who's talking. I suggest you take a look at your post. I see
nothing but unfair and unsubstantiated generalizations. It suggests that the
author is anything but open-minded.
	Next time you feel like posting something like this- save it for 
somebody who cares.
