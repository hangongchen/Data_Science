Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:

(Technically, the messengers aren't even human so
it *can't* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...]

The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of
the Sodomites' "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels.  Again,
application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of
gay Christians is largeely specious.
***
Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because
of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).

what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse  
at all.

In Christ's Love,
Bryan
