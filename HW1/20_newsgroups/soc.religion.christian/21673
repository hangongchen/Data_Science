I'm wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which
I've been thinking about: What was the process used to divide the Bible into
verses. I believe Jerome divided the New Testament, but I've never seen any
discussion of *how* he did this. It seems rather arbitrary, as opposed to, for
example, making each sentence a verse.
