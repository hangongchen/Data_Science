My, my, my.  I knew that I would receive a response to my post, but not
THIS extensive.  Thank you to all who responded; it at least showed that
people were willing to think about it, even though the general response was
a return to the same old "Why should it matter?" question.  To those of you
who were a part of this response, I suggest that you read the articles
covering this same question in soc.culture.african.american, for you are in
DIRE need of some cultural enlightenment.

Hasta luego

Sherlette
