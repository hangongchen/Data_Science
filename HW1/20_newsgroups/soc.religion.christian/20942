Hello,

I'm writing a paper on the role of the catholic church in Poland after 1989. 
Can anyone tell me more about this, or fill me in on recent books/articles(
in english, german or french). Most important for me is the role of the 
church concerning the abortion-law, religious education at schools,
birth-control and the relation church-state(government). Thanx,

                                                 Masja,
"M.M.Zwart"<s0612596@let.rug.nl>
