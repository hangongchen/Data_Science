Subject pretty much says it all - I'm looking for Johnny Hart's (creator
of the B.C. comic stip) mailing address.

For those of you who haven't seen them, take a look at his strips for Good
Friday and Easter Sunday.  Remarkable witness!

If anyone can help me get in touch with him, I'd really appreciate it! 
I've contacted the paper that carries his strip and -- they'll get back to
me with it!

Thanks for your help,
