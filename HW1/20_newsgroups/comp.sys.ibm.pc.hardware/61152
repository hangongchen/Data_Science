I'm writing a driver that needs to remap some I/O ports.  This means
virtual mode.  Unfortunately virtual mode means it won't get along
with expanded memory managers, so I need make it an EMM driver too.

Does anyone out there have EMM code.  Can any point me to an EMM code source?

-Thanks, Morgan
