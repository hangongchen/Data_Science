I am wanting to upgrade from a 386SX-25, to a 486DX-33, and are looking at a
cheap quote from someone offering me a 486DX-33 motherboard, with no ram in
it.  (I will probably sell my old m-board off somewhere)
Now, I have 4 meg of RAM in my 386, which consists of

4 x 9 module 1024KB simms, running at 70 nanoseconds.
    ^^^^^^^^                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Would I encounter problems with the pointed out areas, by throwing these from
one computer to the other?

Any comments gratefully (e-mail preferred) appreciated.
