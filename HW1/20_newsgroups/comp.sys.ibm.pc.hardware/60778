We are looking for some telephone interfaces (boards/boxes) to hook up to a
computer which will be running one of Unix/DOS/Mac.

We want to be able to communicate with a database on the computer using DTMF
and the telephone interface.  It would be nice if the telephone interface
came with a set of library routines (preferably in C++) which we could use to
write our own programs.

We would also like to be able to record and playback voice using the
computer's hard disk for storage.

Does anyone here have any experience with, or knowledge of, any products
which might meet our needs?

Please reply via E-Mail and I will summarize if there is interest.

Thanks.

Monty
