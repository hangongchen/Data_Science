I hope that there's somebody out there that can help us.

Some of our students change the AMI bios passwords on a few of our computers 
and set it for always. What we'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass 
or remove the password. We have tried switching bios, but to no avail. The 
battery is soldered to the bord, an all three machines is still under 
guarentee so if that would have help we can't remove the batteries.

Thanks Isak

:-) Money can't buy happiness, but surely pays for the illusion.
