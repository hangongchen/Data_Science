I have a Roberto Clemente 1969 Topps baseball card for sale, in near-mint
condition (really as close to mint condition as you can get).  It lists for
$55 in my most recent baseball card pricelist for May.  I am offering it for
$50 and I'll pay the certified postage to ship it to you.

Please respond to Jack.T.Sendak@office.wang.com or at 1-800-999-3732 ext. 5269
in Maryland.
