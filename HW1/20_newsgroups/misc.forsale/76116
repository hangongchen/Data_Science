   I looking for someone with the schematics to a Technics 1200
turntable -- I need to get a hold of them as soon as possible 
(by fax maybe?) or is there someone out there who has experienced:
	- a platter that spins backwards slowly
	- a strobe that goes out then flickers if the platter is
spinning?

Get in contact with me as soon as possible
