Ah yes, I see a few liberal weenies have come out of the woodwork
to defend the burning of the children. Probably drooled all over themselves

Probably had a few like that in Nazi Germany, as well.

Oh yeah, ATF/FBI now claims, according the the media, that there are
a few survivors. The number seems to vary minute by minute.
