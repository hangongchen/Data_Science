      The San Francisco Examiner reports that Clinton has issued instructions
to federal law enforcement that they may not kill or injure anyone to 
resolve the Waco situation.  So they've built a fence around the compound,
and are now seriously considering building up the fence to prison-camp
levels, pulling out most of the manpower, and waiting however many months
it takes.
