If one reasons that the United States of America at one time represented 
and protected freedom << individual liberty and personal responsibility >> 
(and I do, in fact, think that this is true) and that totalitarianism << 
absolute government control and tyranny >> represents freedom's opposite 
(which it does), did the USA really win the cold war?

Standard disclaimers ALWAYS apply!
