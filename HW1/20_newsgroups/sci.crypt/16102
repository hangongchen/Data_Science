   Actually, David, I don't think it's any more intellectually honest to
say there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors, unless you've
had a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely.  For all
we know, skipjack could be easily broken, or impossible to break.  And
clearly, if skipjack is not secure, then the clipper chip is not worth much.
