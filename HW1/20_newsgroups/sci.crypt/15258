Does anyone know of a non-word password generator program
for PC's?? i.e. it will produce a nonsense word but still
be pronouncible. e.g. lisgollan

Wanted to "force" users to adopt more secure passwords,
but still be memorable!

Thanks - George Bolt

p.s. please email me as well if possible "george@psychmips.york.ac.uk"
