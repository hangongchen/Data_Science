i don't have FTP and i live in canada ( this means that it would be 
illeagle for a U.S. citizen to send the program to me. their gigerment 
wishes to restrict its dispersil ) but someone in europe must have ported 
a coppy of RSA to the atariST by now.  how do i get a coppy of the RSA 
from a non-FTP news feed?
