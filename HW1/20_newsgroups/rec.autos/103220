Hi:

I am looking for tires.  I would like to hear your experience on the 
BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires and/or the Touring T/A especially for
size P185/70R13.

For Radial T/A: How do they do in SNOW, and WET weather?  Are they quiet tires?

For Touring T/A: How many miles can they last?  I believe they are in
                 every way equal/better than Radial T/A.  Am I right?

-Chan.
