       I just had my rotors on my '92 Taurus GL changed less than 500 miles
   ago and...you guessed it, I'm noticing slight warpage in the left rotor.
   :-(  I had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a
   high spot on the rotor that is causing the problem.  This is a brand new
   rotor bought from a Ford Dealership.  Can't they even produce a brand new
   rotor that is not warped?  I'm currently negotiating with them to swap it
   out for a new rotor.

       This is my first American build car and I'm not overly impressed.
