HELP!!!
my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car.
We live in South Fla., so we are definitely in the right are for one.
My wife has mentioned the Miata, but I think it is too small.
I would like to wait for the new Mustangs ( Dec. '93 I think).
Anyone have any opinions on any/all convertibles in a reasonable price range.

                                           Thanx
