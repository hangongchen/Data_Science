All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident,
get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact
the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they
would in an accident they caused.  Thus no need to go to court.  A friend of
mine did this and he got the money so it does work.
