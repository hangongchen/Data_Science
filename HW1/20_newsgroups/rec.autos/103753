	Tony,  I believe, first of all, that Max's car is an Austrailian
built car.  I don't think its a chopped up U.S. unit.  It may be called a
Kangaroo or Roo or something similar-not sure.  But, I do recall reading
that Austrailian cars used Ford V-8 engines.  The Ford V-8 Interceptor
is, I think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor.  Whatever the case that small car
with a screaming big block Ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for
miles/kilometers.  I hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject.
