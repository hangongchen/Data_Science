Hi all,
I have available to me a set of Metric wheels (came off a Mustang or T-Bird)
which are wearing nearly-bald Michelin TRX 220-55R390 tires.  The only place
I have found these tires is the Tire Rack mailorder place for $121 a pop.
Is there a cheaper source, or another manufacturer of this size tire?  Thanks
for any info...please E-Mail responses and I will post a summary if there is
any interest.
 
     JAS
