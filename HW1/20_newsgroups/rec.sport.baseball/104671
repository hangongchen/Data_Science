Not an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen.  The lefties,
Stanton & Mercker are strong, and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch.
The bullpen is fine, probably superior.

Also false.  Gant, Nixon, Justice, Hunter, Blauser present a decent enough
offense.  EVERYONE is slumping (except Blauser), not just Pendleton.

BTW, what is the story with Brian Hunter?  Is he in the dog house?
