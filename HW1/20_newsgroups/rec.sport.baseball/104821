As the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not
batting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark.  Barry is such an awesome and
consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League.  IMHO, to 
have Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting
4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the
Giants.
