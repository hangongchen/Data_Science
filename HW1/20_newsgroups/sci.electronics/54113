Hi,
	I am looking for a very high speed 
D/A converter (at least 8bits and 150MHz) for
a research application. A paper in  the January
issue of IEEE Solid-State Circuits mentions a 
GaAs, 1GHz, 8bit DAC - anyone know where I can find
such a thing? Even a somewhat slower Si DAC would
do.
	Needless to say, I have looked in all the
conventional places (Vitesse, Motorola, National,
etc. etc.). Any pointers would be appreciated.
