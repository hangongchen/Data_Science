I've got the same problem; I can't dig up any info on the jumper settings
on the hd 3.5" drives.

Can anyone recommend a reference book(s) on the subject, rather than a
"quick fix" type answer??  I was going to start hooking up things and
logging the results, but the prospect of a ten second smoke test deters
me...

Thanks, Kirk Cowen.
