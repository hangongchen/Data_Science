 Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies.  This
is in most cases around the 20-3.3K Hz range.  Pink/White are used to
adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that.  There are a few EQ's out
on the market that have Pink noise built in.  Most all from Audio
Control have them I know the C-101 does.
