Oh yes, the good ol' deutsche Bundespost.  Shortly after moving to Germany,
someone told me that "POST" is an acronym for the "Public Organization for
the Suppression of Technology".  Stimmt, oder?

I miss a lot of things about Germany (yes, including the Bier vending
machines at work that were SUBSIDIZED by the firm), but the phone system
is not one of them.
