Does anyone has a table about the size of the wire to the amount of current it can carry.  Probably in the 1-15amp range.  My friend is interested in converting a Mazda into an electric car.  Needed information for estimation.  Thanks in advance.  

p.s. any info on electric will be greatly appreaciated.
