Hello,

Has anyone used the Requirements Analsys methodology Hatley & Pirbhai ? I am
a British final year real-time degree student, and as a project I am covering
this methodology. I would be very grateful to anyone who could give me their
views on this method. Please mail me if you feel you can help, and I will send
you my questions.

Thanks in advance,

David Phelps	(nwz96h@chelt.ac.uk)
