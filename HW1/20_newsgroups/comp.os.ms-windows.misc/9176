As a beginer, I just wonder how to transfer files from the Sun 
system (which is on the network) to my PC at home (not connected
to the network). I tried to use 'COMit' to do so, but it was very
slow and it seemed that getting multiple files at the same time
was impossible. Could anybody give me some hints & infomation?

Thank you in advance.
