I posted this to the apps group and didn't get any response, so
I'll try here. I am trying to use the latex help feature
available in emacs for windows and read that you need a separate
latexhlp.zip file along with a vms2hlp.zip file to convert this
to windows help. Has anyone found these files or gotten this
command help to work?

Thanks, Steve Herrod
