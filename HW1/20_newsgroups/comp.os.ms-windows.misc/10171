I have a very funny yet confusing problem.  I am using Telemate within
Win 3.1.  Everytime I close dos box, my Telemate operation get affected
(Normally I am doing file transfer).  However, if I open + close windows
program everything seems running smoothly.  My file transfer operation
get affected only if I close dos box.

Can somebody please gimme some pointers on what is going on and how to
fix it??

thanks in advance
