Has anyone experienced problems formatting a system floppy in the File
Manager under DOS 6?  I get a formatted disk but when I boot with it,
my hard drive isn't recognized.  I did install DoubleSpace.  Also, I
*was* able to make a good-working system floppy from the DOS 6 command
shell (no Windows).

Let me know if you've had this problem too and if you've heard what's
going on.
