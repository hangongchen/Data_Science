Hi there,

With a 16Megs of RAM, is there a need to run/load Smartdrv for
Windows 3.1?  If yes, can I run/load Ramdrive without Smartdrv?
If I need both Ramdrive & Smartdrv, is the following Config.Sys
settings OK:  ...SMARTDRV.SYS 2048 2048
              ...RAMDRIVE.SYS 2048 /E

Thanks in advance for e-mail reply.
