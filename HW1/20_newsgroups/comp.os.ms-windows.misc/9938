I'm trying to find Tom Haapanen, formerly tom@wes.on.ca
who was the keeper of the FAQ for this newsgroup.
He was working at Watrerloo Engineering Software,
but netfind can't even find that (but it may have
been a uucp connection).  If anyone knows how to
contact Tom, please let me know.

Thanks,
Tom Schlatter
