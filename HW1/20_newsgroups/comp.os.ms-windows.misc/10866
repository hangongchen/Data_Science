I think somebody posted some info about a biobliography program one or 
two months ago. I don't rember the detail. What I'd like to have is one 
software to organize the literature I'm refereing for scientific 
publications. The functions I'd like would be 
a. able to do data-base managment
b. able to print with special formats for different journals
Any info would be appreciated.
