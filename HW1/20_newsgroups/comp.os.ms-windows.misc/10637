One can only remap special-command keys in procomm it seems. I
would like to remap other keys too - especially "altgr 2", and
such combinations.

Anybody know a plain OR dirty way to do this?? (of cause most
people settle for remapping function keys, but I don't see
why there should be a limitation...)

	Yours, Mattias
