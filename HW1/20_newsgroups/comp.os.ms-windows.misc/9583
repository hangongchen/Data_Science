Hello.

     I purchased a video card called ET-4000 true color card which
     can provide about 1700K colors. But the question is I can't find
     the corresponding drivers for windows 3.1 , I am now using 65k
     colors driver for win31. It works fine , but I think it will be
     better if I use 1700k driver. So, please tell me whether such a
     driver is available !

     Thanks in advance.
