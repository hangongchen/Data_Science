I am looking for EISA or VESA local bus graphic cards that support at least 
1024x786x24 resolution.  I know Matrox has one, but it is very expensive.  All the
other cards I know of, that support that resoultion, are striaght ISA. 

Also are there any X servers for a unix PC that support 24 bits?

thanks
