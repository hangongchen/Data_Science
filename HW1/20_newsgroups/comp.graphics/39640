Hello networld!

I'm looking for documentation/books on parametric drafting.

Does anyone know of such material, electronic on a Gopher/ftp-site
or books/authors.

Im not looking for commercial software rather info on implementation 
and theory of the subject. Im planning to make a parametric
generator for autocad and i would need some referance.

Everything you know is of interest!

Thanks in advace!!
