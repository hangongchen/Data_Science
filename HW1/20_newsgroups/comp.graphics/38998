I am revamping some computer-aided visual inspection systems which
use the old AT&T Targa-16 Board Set (2 cards) to display images from
a color CCD camera to a color monitor, providing the option to overlay
text or a crosshair. No image capture or manipulation is performed, 
just display. I would like to know if there is still a source for 
development libraries which would allow me to embed commands in my
own software to enable the camera, draw crosshairs, print text, etc.
I'll be glad to pay if they are commercially available. E-Mail if
possible.
