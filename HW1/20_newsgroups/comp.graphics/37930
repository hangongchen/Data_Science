	Does anybody know if there are any good 2d-graphics packages
	available for IBM RS/6000 & AIX ? I'm looking for something
	like DEC's GKS or Hewlett-Packards Starbase, both of which
	have reasonably good support for different output devices
	like plotters, terminals, X etc.

	I have tried also xgks from X11 distribution and IBM's implementation
	of Phigs. Both of them work but we require more output devices
	than just X-windows.

	Our salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics and
	I am not expecting for any good solutions from there.
