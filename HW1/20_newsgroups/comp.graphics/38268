Hi Netters,

I'm building a CAD package and need a 3D graphics library that can handle
some rudimentry tasks, such as hidden line removal, shading, animation, etc.

Can you please offer some recommendations?

I'll also need contact info (name, address, email...) if you can find it.

Thanks

(Please Post Your Responses, in case others have same need)
