Summary: Want to know about universal VESA driver
Keywords: VESA
Lines: 12

        Some time ago (about 1 month) there was a bit of discussion
        about a universal VESA driver for > 8bit cards.  It was in
        the file uvesa32.zip.  Well i can't find it, does anyone know
        where it is (gorilla.something.something.au), and what sort
        of cards it works for ?

        Also would it be pushing my luck to ask for someone to post
        it to some appropriate group.
