Does anyone out there have or know of, any kind of utility program for

Ribbons?


Ribbons are a popular representation for 2D shape.  I am trying to
find symmetry axis in a given any 2D shape using ribbons.


Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated how to start program. 


Thanks very much in advance,
Hoi
