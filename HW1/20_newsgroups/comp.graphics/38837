I just donwloaded a *.bin file from a unix machine which is
supposed to be converted to a MAC format. Does anyone know 
what I need to do to this file to get it into any Dos, Mac
or Unix readable format. Someone mentioned fetch on the unix
machine - is this correct? Could someone explain the .bin
format a little?

Thanks,

Elizabeth
