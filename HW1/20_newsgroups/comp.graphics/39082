On a more cheerful note, perhaps hackerism/hacking isn't completely dead.

As someone else said, take the GNU offerings for example - free, redistributable and 
often better than the commercial stuff.  Take also the number of papers published
every year in all the fields of computer science - the vast majority of these papers
detail original work of real, often exceptional merit - and the authors are sharing
this knowledge.

Have Fun,
Roddi
