I am looking for experiences people have had with Mormons and your
views of Mormonism because of these experiences.

I would appreciate only experiences that have happened to you...not
friend of a friend stuff.  Also, I would like to hear good 
experiences you might have had with Mormons.  I am doing this
in the interest of spreading tolerance, so please, no flames.

E-mail would be preferred because of the short time for this.

Thanks,

--Travis
